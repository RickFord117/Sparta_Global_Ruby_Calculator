# Sparta_Global_Ruby_Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in ruby to demonstrate the application of knowledge gained from our Ruby sessions in the class room.

# Using the calculator

To use the calculator, use bash to enter to file directory containing the project and use the command 'ruby app.rb' to run the script. 
The user will be prompted to choose an operation from the given list. When an operation is chosen, the user will then be prompted to enter values which will then be used to get an answer.
Once the answer is given, the code will stop running and the user will need to use the 'ruby app.rb' commande to run the code again.
